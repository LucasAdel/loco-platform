## 2025-01-06: MAJOR DECISION - Migration from Dioxus to Leptos

**Decision**: Migrate from Dioxus to Leptos as the primary frontend framework

**Context**: After initial implementation with Dioxus, discovered superior performance and reactivity benefits of Leptos for our use case

**Original Choice (Dioxus)**:
1. **Yew**: Mature, large ecosystem, Elm-inspired
2. **Leptos**: Fine-grained reactivity, good performance
3. **Sycamore**: Solid.js-inspired, reactive
4. **Percy**: Virtual DOM approach

**Migration Rationale**:
- **Fine-grained Reactivity**: Leptos only updates changed DOM nodes, not entire component trees
- **Better Performance**: Faster hydration, smaller bundle sizes, more efficient updates
- **Superior SSR/CSR**: Seamless integration between server and client rendering
- **Modern Architecture**: More sophisticated signal system than Fermi atoms
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Rapidly improving documentation and community
- **Better TypeScript Integration**: For mixed language projects

**Migration Impact**:
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Significantly faster reactive updates
- ‚úÖ **Bundle Size**: Smaller WASM output due to fine-grained compilation
- ‚úÖ **Developer Experience**: More intuitive reactive programming model
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform**: Better Tauri integration for desktop apps
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Migration Cost**: Required rewriting all frontend components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Leptos patterns
- ‚úÖ **Future-Proof**: Leptos is gaining momentum in Rust web development

## 2025-01-06: Implement Demo Mode for Backend

**Decision**: Create demo mode with mock data instead of requiring database for initial development

**Context**: Build issues and complexity of setting up full database infrastructure blocking progress

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **SQLite in-memory**: Simpler than PostgreSQL but still needs migrations
2. **Docker Compose**: Full PostgreSQL but adds complexity
3. **Embedded database**: Like sled or RocksDB

**Rationale**:
- Allows immediate testing of API endpoints
- Reduces initial setup complexity
- Enables frontend development without database
- Can gradually migrate to real database

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Faster initial development
- ‚úÖ Easier onboarding for new developers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to ensure demo data matches real schema
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must plan migration path to real database

## 2025-01-06: Fix Duplicate Dependencies First

**Decision**: Resolve all Cargo dependency conflicts before continuing feature development

**Context**: Multiple duplicate dependencies (web-sys, tower-http) preventing compilation

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Vendor dependencies**: Copy and modify locally
2. **Fork and patch**: Maintain custom versions
3. **Downgrade versions**: Use older compatible versions

**Rationale**:
- Clean builds are essential for development velocity
- Dependency conflicts cause subtle bugs
- Rust's strict compiler requires resolution

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Basic markers only**: Simpler but less engaging
2. **List view only**: No geographic context
3. **Third-party embed**: Limited customisation

**Rationale**:
- Visual job discovery improves user engagement
- Location-based search is primary use case
- Competitive advantage over text-only platforms
- Australian geography suits map-based approach

**Impact**:

2. **UK English**: Closer to Australian
3. **Mixed**: Use US for code, AU for content

**Rationale**:
- Consistency across entire project
- Shows commitment to local market
- Reduces confusion for Australian team
- Better for Australian users

**Impact**:
- `colour` not `color` in variables
- `organisation` not `organization`
- `licence` not `license`
- Need spell checker configuration

## 2025-01-06: JWT for Authentication

**Decision**: Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens

**Context**: Need stateless authentication for scalability

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Session cookies**: Server state required
2. **OAuth only**: Complex for simple use cases
3. **API keys**: Less secure for web clients

**Rationale**:
- Stateless allows horizontal scaling
- Industry standard for SPAs
- Works well with mobile apps
- Good library support in Rust

**Impact**:
- Client-side token storage needed
- Refresh token rotation complexity
- Clear security model
- Enables microservices future
